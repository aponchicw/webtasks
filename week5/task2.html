  <p id="paragraph">For its time, the Mk V Corolla was an absolute monster of a car. It was made famous by Initial-D, a series depicting the rich and vibrant history of Japanese downhill racing. The 86 was able to overcome even Nissan GT-R skylines by virtue of its immensely light body and exemplary cornering capabilities.The 1.8-liter 136 hp inline-four 4A-GE capped out at 7600 RPM, allowing drivers to enter and exit corners at very high rev rates without losing top-end power, thanks to VTEC predecessor variable valve timing.</p>

After spending the better part of the past three decades painstakingly building its brand on an international scale, it’s now arguably one of the greatest automotive success stories in history. Korean cars have come a long way, having gone from being viewed as disposable commuter cars to award-winning sponsors of the NFL in the past 10 years alone.While its sister company, Kia, offers a more rambunctious approach to automaking and marketing, Hyundai has formed a niche for itself with strong sedans, feisty hatchbacks, and component crossovers. Of late, it’s even begun targeting European luxury brands; first with the Equus and Genesis luxury sedans, then by spinning the Genesis off into its own brand. ";
